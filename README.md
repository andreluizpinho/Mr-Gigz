# Mr-Gigz
An APP where bands can find stages for their talent
This project was developed as a graduated project at LeWagon on Batch #158.  The main purpose is to help bands to find places
where they can play and show their talent.
All developed in Rails, using action cable to create messages between bandas and bars, and a spefic code to emulate a calendar
in a dashboard for the contol of the GIG (events where the bands would perform).
Made with passion and all the best we could give at that moment ...
